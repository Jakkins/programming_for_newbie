**JavaFX MVC FXML, starting point is your Controller, 
View is FXML which is super passive, 
Controller ends up having View logic in it because of how passive FXML is.
Model ends up with JavaFX model objects that the View binds to. 
Gets a bit weird when you want to update these values but you are on a different thread.**
