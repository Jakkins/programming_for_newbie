[SOLID PRINCIPLE](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)

- Java always passes parameter variables by value.
- Object variables in Java always point to the real object in the memory heap.
- A mutable object’s value can be changed when it is passed to a method.
- An immutable object’s value cannot be changed, even if it is passed a new value.
- "Passing by value" refers to passing a copy of the value.
- "Passing by reference" refers to passing the real reference of the variable in memory.
