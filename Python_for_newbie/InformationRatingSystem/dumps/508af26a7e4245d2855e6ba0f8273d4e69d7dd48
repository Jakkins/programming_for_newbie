I have been reading about the position, responsibilities, etc. but I still would like to hear from experienced folks.\n\nI'm currently working as a Cyber Security Engineer where my role is all about hands-on work like OS , firewall, switches, routers configurations, antivirus installations, application whitelisting, and other similar things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm excited about this new opportunity but I'm a bit worried because the new place have a single product only, unlike my current job where we have a wide range of services &amp; solutions (both proprietary and other vendor products) and we even do assessments and consultancy work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm also in my comfort zone where I know how to get help/support and I'm used to the environment. What do you guys think about \"Solution Architect\" in general? It seems like there is also good experience going there and probably I won't get in my current position. \n\nAny tips, or things I should be considering? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advanced!",

I found it to be an enjoyable experience and it opened my eyes up to a difference aspect of cyber security. I will be graduating in May of 2021 and it has been rather difficult to find entry level roles which focus on GRC, specifically TPRM. The only places I seem to be able to find opportunities are with Big 4 companies (I am based in the US). I would like to end up at an industry type company rather than a consulting firm. Is going the consulting route the only way to start a career in GRC? Is there a certain career path I can take to work my way up to those roles? I am interested to see how others started.\n\nThanks!",
